Level 3 Task 1: Web Scraper for Cognifyz Python Internship.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to extract structured data from a website using Python’s web-scraping libraries.
The scraper fetches quotes and authors from a sample website (quotes.toscrape.com) and prints them in a clean, readable format.

3.Parse HTML content using BeautifulSoup
4.Extract selected data (quotes + authors)
5.Display structured data in console
